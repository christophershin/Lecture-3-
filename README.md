Reflection:
While doing this activity I think I had a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of coding shaders.
It sort of feels overwhelming seeing such new concepts whilst also writing the code in a rushed manner.
So I think my weaknesses are, not fully understanding how the code connects to one another and what they do. 
My strength is asking people for help when I have trouble because I ususally have one or two errors in which I 
ask my friends for assistance. An opportunity I identified during this activity is using the WorldPos Shader to 
attach a shader to moving objects.
